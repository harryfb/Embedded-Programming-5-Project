Test / demo program for the AD7705 connected to the raspberry PI!
=================================================================

The AD7705 is a two channel sigma delta converter which has
differential inputs, a PGA and programmable data rates. It's
perfect for slowly changing inputs such as pressure, temperature,
heart rate etc.

The program is interrupt driven and can thus run in a thread
which is woken up by the interrupt. The clock for the ADC is
generated by directly manipulating the registers of the BCM
chip.

This program switches on the clock from the RPI, 
triggers a calibration of the AD, 
reads data from channel 1 and 
prints it on the screen.

This program uses DRDY connected to Port 22 and
waits for a falling edge on this port to read
the data. This is done via interrupts / poll
so that this process sleeps until new data becomes
available.

Make sure you use the new PCB layout from:
http://web.eng.gla.ac.uk/rpi/
which has the interrupt wired up.


To build:

    make

Run it with the command:

    sudo ./ad7705_test
